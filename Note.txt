#include() and require()

These functions in PHP are used to include the contents of one file into another during execution.

include() and require()

Both include the specified file.
Difference: If the file is not found, include() generates a warning and continues execution, while require() generates a fatal error and stops execution.
include_once() and require_once()

Similar to include() and require(), but they ensure a file is included only once, regardless of how many times they are called.
Difference: If the file is not found, include_once() generates a warning and continues execution, while require_once() generates a fatal error and stops execution.
When to use which:

include() and include_once(): For optional files or templates that might not be available.
require() and require_once(): For essential files like configuration files or database connections.
In summary:

Use require or require_once for critical files.
Use include or include_once for optional files.
Use _once variants to prevent duplicate inclusions.



#Database tables
In terms of naming conventions for database tables, it's generally recommended to use plural nouns for table names.
This follows the principle that a table is a collection of records, so the name should reflect the plurality of its contents.
Therefore, subjects would be more standard and conventional than subject.
